Groovy Foundation
=================

What is Groovy?

* Dynamic languge on the JVM since 2003
* Near flat learning curve for Java devs.
* Significantly simplified and intuitive API
   * see http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk/ methods on Object, Collection, etc.
* Default imports (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Differences+from+Java)
* Everything is an object
* Lots more:
   * Closures
   * native syntax for lists and maps
   * GroovyMarkup and GPath support
   * native support for regular expressions
   * polymorphic iteration and powerful switch statement
   * dynamic and static typing is supported - so you can omit the type declarations on methods, fields and variables
   * you can embed expressions inside strings
   * lots of new helper methods added to the JDK
   * simpler syntax for writing beans for both properties and adding event listeners
   * safe navigation using the ?. operator, e.g. "variable?.field" and "variable?.method()" - no more nested ifs to check for null clogging up your code


*"Groovy is like a super version of Java. It can leverage Java's enterprise capabilities but also has cool productivity features like closures, builders and dynamic typing.‚Äù*
